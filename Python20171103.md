#### Python:

* os.path.exists(_path_)
* os.path.isfile(_path_)
* os.path.isdir(_path_)
* os.listdir(_path_)

 **A file has two key properties: a filename(usually written as one word) and a path**

 Key method about File Process: _open()_ return a file object,  _read()_, _write()_, _close()_



- [ ] shutil.copy(source, destination)
- [ ] shutil.move(source, dest)
- [ ] os.unlink(_path_) [ delete the file at path], os.rmdir(_path_), shutil.rmtree(_path_) [This method is very dangeous, strongly recommended instead of send2trash method]  
- [ ] os.walk()
